                I'm a sucker for ancient architecture, I just find it so fascinating. It blows my mind how people built structures as large as they did without the modern technology we have today.

                One of the coolest buildings that we got to see was the pantheon. They say that the building was built in a way that you would be able to fit a perfect sphere inside it. It's also crazy to see ruins with huge pillars of solid marble and wonder what could've been there before it was destroyed.

                Italian food is one of my favourite if not my favourite cusine. Spaghetti, pizza, and lasagna are some of my favourite foods. I don't think there was a single day in Italy that I didn't have some kind of pasta.

                I'm not a huge art person but I can definitely appreciate the effort people put into creating super intricate designs in paintings and in sculptures. In Italy, no matter what city you're in, theres art. Florence, one of the cities I visited is famous it's art from the Renaissance period.

                One of the best showcases of art that I was able to see was in the Vatican Museum. Most notably Michelangelo's <em>The Last Judgement</em> painting on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.
